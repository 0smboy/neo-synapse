# PRD Guard Rules

These rules are treated as continuous execution constraints for Synapse development iterations.

1. Explore before acting: scan current behavior, locate root cause, analyze impact.
2. Prefer optimal implementation: prioritize performance, stability, maintainability.
3. Complete delivery loop: implement -> build -> test/verify -> report.
4. Evidence driven: use code, logs, build/test output for key conclusions.
5. Continuous guard: verify each iteration against these rules.
