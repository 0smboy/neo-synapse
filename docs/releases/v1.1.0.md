# Synapse v1.1.0

Release date: 2026-02-15

## Highlights

- Added **Feature Gallery** in README with four static showcase figures (Figure 1-4).
- Added **Homebrew Cask distribution** with non-conflicting package name: `synapse-oboy`.
- Added **release packaging pipeline** with icon assets and checksums.

## Fixes

- Fixed packaged `.app` AI failures caused by missing `codex` executable in app-launched shell environment.
- Added robust Codex executable resolution:
  - Supports common system paths (`/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, ...)
  - Supports mise paths (`~/.local/share/mise/shims`, `~/.local/bin`)
- Added explicit CLI environment PATH normalization for app runtime.
- Improved Codex failure diagnostics in UI (shows executable resolution target).

## Distribution Assets

This release publishes:

- `Synapse-v1.1.0-macos-arm64.zip`
- `Synapse.icns`
- `synapse-icon-1024.png`

### Manual

1. Download `Synapse-v1.1.0-macos-arm64.zip` from this release.
2. Unzip and move `Synapse.app` to `/Applications`.
