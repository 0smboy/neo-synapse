# Neo-Synapse v2.0.0

The next evolution of Synapse -- a floating command center for macOS with a Siri-like voice pet "Ray".

## Highlights

### Ray Voice Pet (Siri-style)
- Say **"Hi Ray"** or **"Hey Ray"** to wake the voice assistant
- Siri-style glowing orb with ripple animation at screen edge
- Always-on ambient listening with wake word detection
- Voice commands route through the same IntentEngine as keyboard mode
- Four visual states: idle, listening, thinking, responding
- Optional TTS for responses

### Dual-Mode System
- **Keyboard mode**: Hotkey (Option+Space) activates the search panel -- type commands
- **Voice mode**: "Hi/Hey Ray" activates the bubble -- speak commands
- Both modes share the same backend, fully independent

### Clean AI Output Formatting
- Custom block-level markdown renderer (AIResponseRenderer)
- Styled headings, code blocks with copy button, bullet/numbered lists
- Blockquotes with accent bar, proper typography (SF Pro + SF Mono)
- Removed Matrix noise from AI response content

### Session-Based Conversation History
- Conversations grouped into sessions (new on launch or 30 min idle)
- Browse sessions with `/sessions`, search with `/history <keyword>`
- Auto-generated titles per session

### OpenViking-Inspired Memory
- Filesystem paradigm with `synapse://` URI scheme
- Auto-categorization: preferences, facts, identity, goals, skills
- L0/L1/L2 tiered context loading
- Browse with `/tree` or `/memory <category>`

### SynapseVoice (Headless Edition)
- Pet personality system with configurable persona
- pi-agent-core: read/write/edit/bash
- Proactive: schedule, watch, agent commands
