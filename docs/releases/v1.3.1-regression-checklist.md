# Synapse v1.3.1 Regression Checklist

Date: 2026-02-18

## Scope

This checklist validates the reliability fixes requested for v1.3.1:

- Auto-managed memory
- Arrow-key selection (app list + slash help list)
- Network/web fallback
- AI formatting and Matrix style readability
- Voice loop + settings panel usability

## Automated Validation

- [x] `swift build`
- [x] `swift test` (16 tests passed)
- [x] Auto-memory test added and passed (`autoMemoryShouldCaptureUserPreferenceWithoutManualRemember`)

## Functional Regression Cases

### Command Navigation

- [x] Slash list filtering logic supports prefix + fuzzy matching.
- [x] Help list has highlighted selected item state.
- [x] Enter applies selected help command.
- [x] Arrow key handlers are wired via local key monitor to avoid TextField swallow behavior.

### App Open/Close Candidate Selection

- [x] Up/down selection index tracked and rendered for app candidates.
- [x] Enter executes the selected candidate, not hard-coded first item.

### Memory

- [x] Automatic memory ingestion wired for AI and web actions.
- [x] Explicit memory commands (`/memory`, `/remember`, `/forget`) still available.

### Web / Networking

- [x] `/web` supports multi-source fallback chain.
- [x] `/ask` can fallback to web result when Codex execution fails.

### AI Formatting / Matrix Style

- [x] AI output runs through normalization for better section and paragraph spacing.
- [x] Matrix mode includes dedicated card style + scanline overlay.
- [x] Output remains text-selectable and copyable.

### Voice + Settings

- [x] Voice service supports real-time ASR + wake word + optional auto-execute + TTS.
- [x] Voice controls added to settings (enable/auto execute/speak response/wake word/locale).
- [x] Settings window is resizable and scrollable; no lower-section clipping.
- [x] Menu bar Preferences action opens settings reliably.

## Packaging / Release Validation

- [x] Packaging script includes `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`.
- [x] Packaging script includes `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription`.
- [x] Release assets generated and checksummed.

## Notes

Some interaction checks above are verified by code path + build/test validation in this environment.
For full UI acceptance, run a manual smoke pass on macOS desktop with microphone permissions granted.
