# Synapse v1.3.1

Release date: 2026-02-18

## Summary

v1.3.1 focuses on execution reliability, keyboard navigation fixes, true in-app voice command loop, and English-first documentation.

## Added

- Automatic memory ingestion from user interactions (no manual-only memory workflow).
- In-app voice command pipeline:
  - real-time speech recognition (ASR)
  - wake word support
  - optional auto-execute after recognition
  - optional TTS response playback
- Web search fallback chain (DuckDuckGo -> Wikipedia -> Bing RSS).
- Knowledge-query web fallback when Codex CLI is unavailable.

## Changed

- Arrow-key selection now works for:
  - app open/close candidate list
  - slash help list (`/`)
- Enter key applies the selected slash-help item.
- AI output formatting improved for readability:
  - better spacing and structure
  - stronger Matrix style treatment (layout + scanline overlay)
- Settings panel is scrollable/resizable and no longer clips lower controls.
- Package `Info.plist` now includes:
  - `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`
  - `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription`
- README/CHANGELOG/ABOUT and release notes moved to English-first.

## Fixed

- Menu bar "Preferences" action now opens settings reliably.
- Embedded settings panel no longer suffers from nested-scroll clipping.

## Regression Validation

Automated:
- `swift build` passed
- `swift test` passed (`16 tests passed`)

Targeted checks completed in this release cycle:
- Slash command navigation path
- App candidate selection path
- Auto-memory ingestion path
- Knowledge fallback path
- Packaging metadata with voice permissions
